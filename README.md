## [bgg-data-scrape.ipynb](https://github.com/ahuang-281/board-game-recommender/blob/master/bgg-data-scrape.ipynb)
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for gathering board game information and ratings from boardgamegeek.com using a combination of web scraping and their public API.
## [bgg-data-clean.ipynb](https://github.com/ahuang-281/board-game-recommender/blob/master/bgg-data-clean.ipynb)
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for trimming the dataset of games or users with low numbers of ratings.  The ratings are also organized into a "long" data format for later input into the predictive models.
